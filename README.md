# Ibexa content type information tab

You are woking on Ibexa 4.x issue and to solve the task you are checking a content in the location view, you don't want to waste time and you need to quickly know what content type identifier of that content object is. 

Now you are lost because you have to click on content types and if your project is big enough it will be organized by folders, and click again, and again. Since we still don't have any search engine we have to go page by page guessing more or less where we can find it. 

A minute has already passed and you think "such a simple action as clicking on a tab makes my day a little better".

### This bundle provides a tab in the location view on back office with the basic content type information
